"vibmodel2.py" defines 2d cnn model: ModelTest2_4_Res
"vibmodel.py" defines 1d cnn model: ModelTest4_plus
"vibdataset.py" is used to load and process 1d vibration signal
"vibdataset2.py" is used to load, process 1d vibration signals and then transform them into 2d spectrograms.
use "vibtrain.py" to train the model
use "vibpredict.py" to test the model
