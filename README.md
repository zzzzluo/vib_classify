# vib_classify
This is the code for the graduation project: Vehicle Vibration Signal Classification Using Deep Learning. 
All vehicle vibration signals are collected using a set of strain gauges. Data is stored in the form of excel files. 
Each timestamp corresponds to a strain value. 
The code for 1d cnn and 2d cnn models and training can be found in the code folder.
